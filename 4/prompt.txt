Every section has a unique ID number, and each Elf is assigned a range of section IDs.

However, as some of the Elves compare their section assignments with each other,
they've noticed that many of the assignments overlap. To try to quickly find overlaps and reduce duplicated effort,
the Elves pair up and make a big list of the section assignments for each pair (your puzzle input).

For example, consider the following list of section assignment pairs:

2-4,6-8
2-3,4-5
5-7,7-9
2-8,3-7
6-6,4-6
2-6,4-8
For the first few pairs, this list means:

Within the first pair of Elves, the first Elf was assigned sections 2-4 (sections 2, 3, and 4), while the second Elf was assigned sections 6-8 (sections 6, 7, 8).
The Elves in the second pair were each assigned two sections.
The Elves in the third pair were each assigned three sections: one got sections 5, 6, and 7, while the other also got 7, plus 8 and 9.

In how many assignment pairs does one range fully contain the other?

A few examples of an assignment pair that fully contains the other would be 
2-8,3-7
6-6,6-9

This is because the range 2-8 fully contains the numbers 3,4,5,6,7 which make up the range of the second Elf
For the second example the number 6 in the range 6-6 is contained within 6-9
