There are three groups.
Each member of a group carries a badge identifying their group.
For efficiency, within each group of three members, the badge is the only item type carried by all three.
That is, if a group's badge is item type B, then all three members will have item type B somewhere in their rucksack, and at most two of the members will be carrying any other item type.

We need to find out the item type for each group from the input (from the file input.txt)
The only way to tell which item type is the right one is by finding the one item type that is common between all three members in a group.

Every set of three lines in your list corresponds to a single group, but each group can have a different badge item type. 
For example, the first group's rucksacks are the first three lines:

vJrwpWtwJgWrhcsFMMfFFhFp
jqHRNqRjqzjGDLGLrsFMfFZSrLrFZsSL
PmmdzqPrVvPwwTWBwg
And the second group's rucksacks are the next three lines:

wMqvLMZHhHMvwLHjbvcjnnSBnvTQFn
ttgJtRGJQctTZtZT
CrZsJsPPZsGzwwsLwLmpwMDw
In the first group, the only item type that appears in all three rucksacks is lowercase r; this must be their badges. In the second group, their badge item type must be Z.

Lowercase item types a through z have priorities 1 through 26.
Uppercase item types A through Z have priorities 27 through 52.
Priorities for these items must still be found (based on the three rules below) to organize the sticker attachment efforts: here, they are 18 (r) for the first group and 52 (Z) for the second group. The sum of these is 70.

Find the item type that corresponds to the badges of each three-Elf group. What is the sum of the priorities of those item types?
